# Anti-Plagiarism-Software
It is a anti - plagiarism software. Not to be reused without permission.
You need to feed in two or more text files and it will give you number of times particular words are repeated in individual files and number of unique words they contain. It will also print out top 10% and least 10% of the words from both the text files. Currently I am feeding text files into program from console. So to run this program you need to make jar file of the main class and then feed in text files.
